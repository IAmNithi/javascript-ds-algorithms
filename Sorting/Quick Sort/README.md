## What is Quick Sort ?

Quicksort is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of a random access file or an array in order. Developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961, it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting.

## Quick Sort

* Like merge sort, exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted
* Works by selecting one element (called the "pivot") and finding the index where the pivot should end up in the sorted array
* Once the pivot is positioned appropriately, quick sort can be applied on either side of the pivot
