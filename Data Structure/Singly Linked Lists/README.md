## What is a linked list?

A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.

Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null

## Comparisons with Arrays

### Lists

* Do not have indexes!
* Connected via nodes with a next pointer
* Random access is not allowed

### Arrays

* Indexed in order!
* Insertion and deletion can be expensive
* Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
